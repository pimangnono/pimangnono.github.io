# What is a Callback?

A callback is a **function** that is to be executed **after** another function has finished executing.

Any function that is passed as an argument is called a **callback function**.

```dart
Question(
	questions[_questionIndex]['questionText'],
),
...(questions[_questionIndex]['answers'] as List<String>)
	.map((answer) {
  return Answer(_answerQuestion, answer);
}).toList()
```

In this case, `Answer(_answerQuestion, answer)` is the callback function.

Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesnâ€™t execute until other code has already finished execution.

# map

It is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key has exactly one value.

```dart
 {key : value}
```

```dart
const questions = [
      {
        'questionText': 'what\'s your favorite color?',
        'answers': ['black', 'red', 'green'],
      },

      {
        'questionText': 'what\'s your favorite animal?',
        'answers': ['dog', 'cat', 'dragon'],
      },
      {
        'questionText': 'what\'s your favorite holiday?',
        'answers': ['new year', 'christmas', 'easter'],
      },
    ];
```

## Take out values in the list

```dart
Question(
	questions[_questionIndex]['questionText'],
),
...(questions[_questionIndex]['answers'] as List<String>)
	.map((answer) {
  return Answer(_answerQuestion, answer);
}).toList()
```

- **.toList()** : to tell Dart that we want list not map
- **...** : spread operator. Take a list and pull all the values present in the list and add them to the surrounding list as an individual value
- **'answers'**: anonymous function as it need not to be defined anywhere else

<br>

# const vs final

```dart
const Function_name;
final Function Function_name;
```

- **const** : time-constant so it **never** changes
- **final** : runtime constant so it does not change once it has its initial value

<br>

## function that can be overwritten

```dart
var Function_name
```

can be overwritten after it is defined. Eg.

```dart
var refrigerator = ['ice cream', 'hotdogs'];

refrigerator = []
```

Whereas 

```dart
const Function_name
```

cannot be overwritten.
