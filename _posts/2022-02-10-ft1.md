# how to create new project

<br>

1. open Window command prompt

2. cd 프로젝트 폴더

3. flutter create 프로젝트 이름(no dash, dots, space)

4. vscode - terminal- new terminal >> command prompt is now integrated into vs code

5. type 'flutter run' on the terminal (inside project) >> run vs code on the android emulator

6. if crush with message 'kotlin could not find the required JDK tools':

   - google for JDK8 (oracle.com)
   - download file 

7. (one time only) main.dart - line 58 - _counter = _counter + 2로 고치기

8. 이제부터 flutter run 대신 r만 써도됨

9. r = hot reload, R= hot restart 

10.  5~9번 대신에 run-run with/without debugging 선택 >> 저장만하면 자동으로 update
