# how to create new project

<br>

1. open Window command prompt
2. cd 프로젝트 폴더
3. flutter create 프로젝트 이름(no dash, dots, space)
4. vscode - terminal- new terminal >> command prompt is now integrated into vs code
5. type 'flutter run' on the terminal (inside project) >> run vs code on the android emulator
6. if crush with message 'kotlin could not find the required JDK tools':
   - google for JDK8 (oracle.com)
   - download file 
7. (one time only) main.dart - line 58 - _counter = _counter + 2로 고치기
8. 이제부터 flutter run 대신 r만 써도됨
9. r = hot reload, R= hot restart 
10.  5~9번 대신에 run-run with/without debugging 선택 >> 저장만하면 자동으로 update

- .idea: holds some configuration for Android Studio. 
- android: A passive folder used by Flutter. holds a complete Android project as you could also create it without Flutter. This is in the end the project which the Flutter SDK will use to merge with your Flutter code, so when the code gets compiled to native code it will basically injected into this Android project. And that is the Android project which will be built into a real Android app. 
-  build: A passive folder. holds the output of your Flutter app. This is generated and managed by the Flutter SDK. You shouldn't change anything in there, that will all be done automatically by the Flutter SDK when you are developing.
- ios: same for android folder.
- <b>lib</b>: stands for library. It is where all Dart files are added.
- <b>test</b>: to write tests for our application, automated tests - code that runs our code and tests it for certain things. 
- <b>gitignore</b>: helps you when using git which is a source code management tool, which allows you to create snapshots of your code, save them and go back to them at later point. 
- metadata: managed automatically by Flutter SDK
- packages: managed automatically by Flutter SDK
- projectname.iml: managed automatically by Flutter SDK to manage some internal dependencies and settings for the project.
- <b>pubspec.yaml</b>: allows you to manage dependencies of your project, meaning that you can configure which other third-party packages your project might be using. Also congifure fonts, images, etc. 
- pubspec.lock: managed automatically as .yaml is generated. holds more details about all the dependencies you have and is required by Flutter.
- README.md: automatically generated. holds information about project and can be changed if you were sharing your project with other developers
