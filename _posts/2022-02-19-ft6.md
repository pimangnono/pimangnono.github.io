# If

```dart
if (condition, true by default) {code}
```

```dart
void main() {
  var isLoggedIn = true;
  var userName = 'jayden';
  var password = 'hooray';
  var age = 17;
  if (userName == 'jayden' && (password == 'hooray' || age != 20)) {
    print('Logged in!');
  } else if (isLoggedIn) {
    print('Overruled@');
  } else {
    print('Failed');
  }
}
```

- **&&** : and operator
- **||** : or operator

<br>

# Ternary Expression

```dart
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
```

- **condition**: An expression. After `?` there should only be **one** expression
- **exprIfTrue**: An expression which is evaluated if the condition is **true**
- **exprIfFalse**: An expression which is executed if the condition is **false**

<br>

There are some things that you can do with the ternary operator but canâ€™t do with if-else. For example, if you need to **initialize a constant or reference**:

```dart
const int number = (some conditions) ? 100 : 1;
```

So in the quiz app, after the last question is answered an error page is shown. To replace it with a text page: 

```dart
body: _questionIndex < questions.length
            ? Column(
                children: [
                  Question(
                    questions[_questionIndex]['questionText'] as String,
                  ),
                  ...(questions[_questionIndex]['answers'] as List<String>)
                      .map((answer) {
                    return Answer(_answerQuestion, answer);
                  }).toList()
                ],
              )
            : Center(
                child: Text('You did it!'),
              ),
```

- **Center()** : centers all the content horizontally and vertically on the page

# null 

null is useful when you want to model data you don't have. eg) middle name

<br>

## null safety

It partition your variables into nullable and non-nullable ones. By default, variables are non-nullable so you would get error if

```dart
void main() {
	var isNull(null);
}
```

<br>

```dart
void main() {
  String userName = 'jay';
  userName = null;
  }
}
```

In this case, the message you get is 'A value of type null can't be assigned to a variable of type String'.

To avoid this you need to add to tell Dart :

- `?` :  that this variable could be non-nullable as well as nullable
- `!` : that this variable is definitely non-nullable

```dart
void main() {
  String? userName = 'jay';
  userName = null;
  }
}
```
