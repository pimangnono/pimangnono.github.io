# Widgets inside a widget

```dart
class QuizApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    var questions = [
      'what\'s your favorite color?',
      'what\'s your favorite animal?'
    ]; 
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('The questions!'),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Answer 1'),
              onPressed: null,
            ),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Answer 2'),
              onPressed: null,
            ),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Answer 3'),
              onPressed: null,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<br>

## HEAD

- **Scaffold()** : create basic design, structure and color scheme. It has a named argument, hit control space to get some auto completion in the IDE
- **appBar:** : 앱 상단에 위치한 부분

<br>

## BODY

Body accepts only **one widget**.

- **Column()** : items placed above each other
- **Row()** : items placed next to each other
- **[]** : a list of widgets
- **RaisedButton()** : has been deprecated with `ElevatedButton()` for Ver.2
- **onpressed** : function that should be executed when button is pressed
- **children** : pass list of widgets to another widget
- **child** : pass a widget to another widget

<br>

**! TIP to write a clear code !** 

Always **add a comma after closing parentheses** because this will allow you to autoformat this in a very readable way

# Changing Widgets

```dart
class QuizApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() {
    // TODO: implement createState
    return QuizAppState();
  }
}

class QuizAppState extends State<QuizApp> {
  var questionIndex = 0; 
  void answerQuestion() {
    setState(() {
      questionIndex = questionIndex + 1;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    var questions = [
      'what\'s your favorite color?',
      'what\'s your favorite animal?'
    ];
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text(questions[questionIndex]),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Answer 1'),
              onPressed: answerQuestion,
            ),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Answer 2'),
              onPressed: () => print('Answer 2 Chosen!'),
            ),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Answer 3'),
              onPressed: () {
                print('Answer 3 Chosen!');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

<br>

## Click button

```dart
onPressed: answerQuestion,
```

`answerQuestion()`을 쓰면 이 function executed simultaneously as its return value is passed to the `onPressed`. By using `answerQuestion` (name of function), we ensure that `RaisedButton` is the one executing the function when user press.

If you have a function that is called only once (unlike `answerQuestion`) and not in anywhere else in this app then you can write either:

```dart
onPressed: () => print('Answer 2 Chosen!'),
```

- **()** : anonymous function - no need to define

```dart
onPressed: () {
    print('Answer 3 Chosen!');
},
```

or above for longer function.

<br>

## Change on screen when click button

<br>

### what is a state?

<img src="../../images/2022-02-12-ft3/image-20220215162616281.png" alt="image-20220215162616281" style="zoom:50%;" />

<br>

### stateless vs stateful

<img src="../../images/2022-02-12-ft3/image-20220215162711660.png" alt="image-20220215162711660" style="zoom:50%;" />

- **statelesswidget** - can't re-run `build()` upon changing properties

- **statefulwidget** has two classes - `QuizApp` and `QuizAppState`
- `QuizApp` can be recreated when external data changes but `QuizAppState` is persistent

<br>

### Connecting QuizAppState to QuizApp

```dart
class QuizApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() {
    // TODO: implement createState
    return QuizAppState();
  }
}

class QuizAppState extends State<QuizApp> {
  var questionIndex = 0; 
  void answerQuestion() {
    setState(() {
      questionIndex = questionIndex + 1;
    });
  }
```

- **createState()** : is a method that takes no argument but in the end has to return a state object that is connected to `StatefulWidget`
- **\<QuizApp>** : to connect `QuizApp` and `QuizAppState`

<br>

### Change question when press button

- **var questionIndex = 0;** : not created inside `build()` as it will be reset and change everytime build runs and actually Flutter executes build when it needs to rebuild the interface on the screen
- **void answerQuestion()** **{}**: excuted function when pressed button
- **setState(() {});** : is a "trigger" that informs Flutter that it needs to re-run `build()` of the Widget. Without it, the widget does change its property value but it will not re-run the `build()` method. Hence, updates aren't reflected on the screen
- **questionIndex = questionIndex + 1;** : next question (in the list) loaded when user press button

<br>

## Open widget from different file

It is better to use **one widget per file**.

Exception: if two widgets only work together or you don't really plan on reusing a widget in other files

<br>

[question.dart file]

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// type st and select
class Question extends StatelessWidget {
  final String qustionText;
  Question(this.qustionText);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(qustionText);
  }
}
```

- **final String qustionText;** : tells Dart that this value will never change after its initialization `Question(this.questionText)` in the constructor
- **Question(this.qustionText)** : constructor that stores positional argument in the` var questionText`

<br>

### Link question.dart file to main.dart file

[main.dart file]

```dart

import './question.dart';

```

everything in `question.dart` file is also available in this file unless the name has underscore in front of the name i.e. `_question.dart`

<br>

#### private property

```dart
class _QuizAppState extends State<QuizApp> {
  var _questionIndex = 0;
  void _answerQuestion() {
    setState(() {
      _questionIndex = _questionIndex + 1;
    });
  }
```

_ : a syntax. leading underscore restricts access to the public property -> turns to a private property

<br>

As a result,

```dart
body: Column(
          children: [
            Text(questions[questionIndex]),
```

is changed to

```dart
body: Column(
          children: [
            Question(questions[_questionIndex]),
```
