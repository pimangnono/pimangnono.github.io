# What is machine learning?

According to Tom Mitchell, "A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some class of **tasks T** and **performance measure P**, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

<br>

## Types of machine learning algorithms

There are two types of machine learning algorithms : supervised and unsupervised learning.

<br>

### supervised learning

'correct' data sets are given to find a relationship between input and output. 

There are 2 supervised learning problems : **regression** and **classification**.

- regression

  we can predict results within continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some **continuous function**

- classification

    we can predict results in a **discrete** output.
