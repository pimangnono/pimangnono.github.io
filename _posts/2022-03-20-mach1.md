# What is machine learning?

According to Tom Mitchell, "A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some class of **tasks T** and **performance measure P**, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

<br>

## Types of machine learning algorithms

There are two types of machine learning algorithms : supervised and unsupervised learning.

<br>

### supervised learning

'correct' data sets are given to find a relationship between input and output. Data set used for the supervised learning is called training set.  

There are 2 supervised learning problems : **regression** and **classification**.

- regression

  we can predict results within continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some **continuous function**.

- classification

    we can predict results in a **discrete** output.

<br>

### unsupervised learning

Raw data are given to derive structure by finding relationships among the variables in the data. No feedback for the predicted results. 

Example : 

- clustering algorithms - cluster similar data into groups
- non-clustering algorithms - the "Cocktail Party Algorithm" allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment.

# Model Representation

Terminology 

![Model Representation _ Coursera - Chrome 2022-03-20 오후 11_49_45](../../images/2022-03-20-mach1/Model Representation _ Coursera - Chrome 2022-03-20 오후 11_49_45.png)

In supervised learning, training set is given to learn a hypothesis, or a function.
