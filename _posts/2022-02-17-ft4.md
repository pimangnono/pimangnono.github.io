# Container ()

`Container()` has a bunch of settings that allow you to space things and to align things

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: double.infinity,

      margin: EdgeInsets.all(10),

      child: Text(
        qustionText,
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 28),
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
      ),
    );
  }
```

- **double.infinity** : gives you a width that ensures that the container takes as much width as it can get   i.e. full width of screen so that now the Text does not use its text as a measurement for how big it should be, but the surrounding widget
- **margin** : is spacing around the container
- **EdgeInsets.all()** : enum
- **style** : is not a widget but a normal object based on the TextStyle class
- **TextAlign.** : enum
